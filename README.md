This repository consists of work done during the Code In Place course held by Stanford University over quarantine. The course corresponds to the first half of their CS106A course and teaches programming in Python. I have also worked on my own projects outside of Code in Place which include a Brickbreaker game that was an option for the final project in Code in Place, editing an image so that another image is resized pasted onto the background image, a "What snack should you have?" quiz using Tkinter, a number-guessing program, a temperature converter, and a coin flip program.
