This folder contains the personal projects I worked on following the completion of Code In Place. 

The Image_Editing sub-folder contains the code and images required for an image editing program that takes a common description applied to corgis online and makes it literal.

The other project descriptions are as follows:
1. brickbreaker.py - This is the classic game in which the player uses a paddle to direct a bouncing ball to hit as many bricks as possible without missing the paddle. If the player misses the paddle then the game ends.
2. coin_flip.py - Acts as a coin flip program that asks the user if they would like to flip a coin, prints the outcome of heads or tails, and quits flipping when the user presses ctrl-c.
3. even_num.py - This program prints the first 100 even numbers backwards.
3. extension.py - This program prints multiples of 3 under 1000.
4. num_guessing.py - This program acts as a number guessing game that generates a random number in a certain range. The user then guesses, with hints about whether their guess is too high or low, until they guess the correct number.
5. odd_num.py - This program prints the first 100 odd numbers.
6. temp_converter.py - This program asks the user what temperature conversion they would like to do, asks them for the temperature they would like to convert from one measure to
the other, then prints the converted temperature.
