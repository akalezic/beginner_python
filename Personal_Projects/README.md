This folder contains the personal projects I worked on following the completion of Code In Place.

The project descriptions are as follows:
1. coin_flip.py - Acts as a coin flip program that asks the user if they would like to flip a coin, prints the outcome of heads or tails, and quits flipping when the user presses ctrl-c.
2. even_num.py - This program prints the first 100 even numbers backwards.
3. extension.py - This program prints multiples of 3 under 1000.
4. num_guessing.py - 
5. odd_num.py - 
6. temp_converter.py -
