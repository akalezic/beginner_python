Corgis are often described as being shaped like loaves of bread. I wanted to use Python to make this an even more literal description by pasting an image of a loaf of bread over a my favorite corgi's body. 
The program resizes, positions, and pastes an image of a loaf of bread over an image of a corgi so it covers his body. The necessary images are included in the images file.
