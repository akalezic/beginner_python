Corgis are often described as being shaped like loaves of bread. I wanted to use Python to make this an even more literal description by pasting an image of a loaf of bread over my favorite corgi's body. 
The program resizes, positions, and pastes an image of a loaf of bread over an image of a corgi so it covers his body. This program uses the SimpleImage library and the Image, ImageDraw, and ImageFilter libraries imported from the Pillow library. The necessary images are included in the images file.

The simpleimage.py file may also prove useful so I have included it.
