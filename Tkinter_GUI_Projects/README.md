The projects in this subfolder are personal projects I made following Code In Place using tkinter.
1. brickbreaker.py - This program acts as the classic game Brickbreaker, where a paddle is used to help a ball bounce around the canvas and get rid of bricks as it goes. The game is over when the ball misses the paddle. This program was an optional final project from Code In Place, though I chose to make an animated graph of COVID-19 data instead. The paddle function was provided through Code In Place.
2. snack_quiz.py - This program uses tkinter to create a GUI in which questions and buttons are printed that ask the user a series of questions to help them narrow down what kind of snack they want.
3. tea_rec.py - This program uses tkinter to create a CUI in which questions and buttons are printed that help recommend a tea for a user based on their answers to the questions. Once enough information is obtained, the program opens a webpage for the recommended tea.
