These projects were part of a series of mathematical/numerical assignments given in Code In Place.

The assignments are described as follows:
1. hailstones.py - This program mimics a problem in Douglas Hofstadter's "Godel, Escher, and Bach," in which the problem takes whatever number is input by the user and divides even numbers by 2, and multiplies resulting odd numbers by 3 and adds 1 untilthe final number is 1. The program then prints how many steps it took to reach 1.
2. khansole_academy.py - This program generates random simple addition problems and asks the user what the correct answer is. It tracks if the user gets 3 correct responses in a row, and keeps asking questions until they have achieved three correct responses in a row.
3. liftoff.py - This program counts down from 10 to 1 and prints "Liftoff!" like a rocket launch.
4. moon_weight.py - This program takes the weight that the user inputs and prints the equivalent weight on the moon.
5. nimm.py - This program mimics the game of Nimm, in which there is a pile of 20 stones in between two players. On each turn a player must take one or two stones. The players continue taking turns until there are no stones left. The last player to take a stone loses.
6. random_numbers.py - This program prints a series of random numbers using the random library in Python.
7. subtract_numbers.py - This program takes two numbers input by the user and subtracts them, then prints the result.
