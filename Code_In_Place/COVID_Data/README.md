This file contains my final project during Code In Place. For the final project students were encouraged to choose their own final project with what they had learned throughout Code In Place. I decided to analyze COVID-19 data. This program presents an animated graph of April 2020 COVID-19 cases in the United States. 
  
The data analysis and animation required the use of the datetime, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, and matplotlib.animation Python libraries. The .csv file I drew from is also included. This data is from the CDC website.
