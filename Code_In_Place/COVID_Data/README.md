This file contains my final project during Code In Place. For the final project students were encouraged to choose what they would like to work on for their final project. I decided to analyze COVID-19 data. This program presents an animated graph of April 2020 COVID-19 cases in the United States. The data analysis and animation required the use of the datetime, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, and matplotlib.animation Python libraries. The .csv file I drew from is also included. This data is from the CDC website.
