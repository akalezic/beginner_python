The **Image_Editing** folder consists of image editing projects presented in Code In Place, such as a program that applies a filter to an image chosen by the user, or a default image, a program that takes an image and creates a new image with the original image and its vertical reflection, a program that highlights pixels of a specific intensity and turns the rest of the image gray, and a program that creates a collage of images with colored filters over the images.

The **Numerical_Projects** folder consists of numerical and mathematical projects presented in Code In Place, such as a program that counts down like a rocket launch liftoff counter, a program that presents simple addition problems and keeps providing new addition problems until the user gets three correct in a row, a program that subtracts one number from another and prints the answer, and programs that mimic popular math games and problems.

Further description can be found within each folder's README.md.
