The Image_Editing folder consists of image editing projects presented in Code In Place, such as a program that applies a filter to an image chosen by the user, or a default image, a program that takes an image and creates a new image with the original image and its vertical reflection, a program that highlights pixels of a specific intensity and turns the rest of the image gray, and a program that creates a collage of images with colored filters over the images.

Further description can be found within the folder's README.md.
