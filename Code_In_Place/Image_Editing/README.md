These projects were part of a series of Code In Place assignments focused on editing images. These projects require the user to install the Pillow library.

The assignment descriptions are as follows:
1. codeinplace_filter.py - Applies a pinkish filter over the image specified by the user, or the default image if not specified.
2. forest_fire.py - This program highlights fires in the image by identifying pixels whose red intensity is high enough (more information in file). The sufficiently red pixels are highlighted while the rest of the image is turned gray.
3. reflection.py - This program takes an image and generates a new image where the top is the same as the original image and the bottom is a reflected version of that image.
4. warhol_filter.py - This program generates a collage of six copies of a single image, each of which has a different color filter over it, mimicking Andy Warhol's art.
5. simpleimage.py - Includes the SimpleImage package which we used to manipulate the files.
